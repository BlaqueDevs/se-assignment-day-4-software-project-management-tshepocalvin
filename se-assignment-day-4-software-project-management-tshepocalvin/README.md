        - Develop a budget plan
        - Use cost tracking softwares
        - Use Ciritical Path Method
        - Identify potential risks and provide solutions beforehand

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
    - Agile is repetative and iterative
    - Water fall is sequential and linear

    Advantages:
        - Agile can adapt to change quckly
        - Waterfall is easy to manage

    Disadvantage:
        - Agile is less predictable
        - Waterfall is hard to include changes

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
    - Agile is for projects that have a less rigid scope and may have requirements changed.
    - Waterfall is for projects that ussually have fixed predefined scopes, and strict regualtions.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
    - Hosting code reviews

    - Maintaining high standards will ensure the product is not of low quality, and will also prevent difficult maintanace.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
    - It will prevent over-estimation of project requirements. 
    - WBS is a tool presents a project in small, managable tasks.

    - Real-life problems a software solution has to solve

    - Target audience need to reliase the need for the software solution, because without a problem there's no need for a solution.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
    - Clearly defining the problem will make it easy to identify the target market.
    - It makes it better to understand and estimate the solution's needs such as time, cost.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
    - By explaining what the solution intends to solve
    - Why the target market needs of the solution
    - How the solution impacts the target

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
    - Use of unique approaches and technology that outshines competitors
    - Features simplify tasks for users
    - The solution focuses on simplifying use and improving productivity

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
    - Government stats and private company surveys indicate a significant markets size
    - using trends from the past to predict future growth

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
    - Market trends decide what is relevant and what isn't
    - So using research and feedback from users can give rise to new features and updates
